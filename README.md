## Getting Started (Node.js + Hapi framework)

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Installing Node and NPM is pretty straightforward using the installer package available from the (Node.jsÂ® web site)[https://nodejs.org/en/].

### Configuring your project (Node.js with Hapi framework)

Use NPM (version 7.6 or higher) to initialize your project and create package.json to store project dependencies.

```
npm init
```

Install crypto-js with --save flag to save dependency to our package.json file

```
npm install crypto-js --save
```

Install level with --save flag

```
npm install level --save
```

Install hapi (REST Framework) with --save flag

```
npm install hapi --save
```

## Start the server

To test code:

- Open a command prompt or shell terminal after install node.js.
- Enter a node session, also known as REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop).

```
npm start
```
 or

```
node server.js
```
